Simple app to see what <a href="https://docs.harperdb.io/docs">Harper</a> can do.

Some notes:
- this isn't a 'production ready' app
- there are no tests (see above item)
- it _should_ just run and be available at the <a href="https://localhost:9926/">default harper https endpoint</a> (after npm i).
